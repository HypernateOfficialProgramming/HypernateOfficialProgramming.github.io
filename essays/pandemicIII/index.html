    <h1>The Pandemic - A school essay (III)</h1>
    <p>During The 11th of March in the year 2020, The global COVID-19 outbreak was declared as a pandemic by World Health Organization. Everyone wAS wearing masks to shield themselves from the incoming invasion, a strain of viruses known as <b>SARS-CoV-2</b>.
    <p>People were dying left and right as many caught the infection, failling into terminal illness.</p>
    <p>Almost all airports were closed due to this disaster, and the hoarding of resources became increasingly more common.</p>
    <p>In some areas, hotels were converted into quarantine zones for the virus.</p>
    <p>My area never realized this until February 2022, where many people were hospitalized.</p>
    <h3>The Grand Cure</h3>
    <p>Finally, a few months after the event, a cure was developed. Most if not all had two progressive shots, a primary and, after 6 months, a booster shot.</p>
    <p>
    And just like that, everyone was immune now.
