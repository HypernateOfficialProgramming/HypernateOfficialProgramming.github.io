    <h1>The Pandemic - A school essay</h1>
    <p>During The 11th of March in the year 2020, The global COVID-19 outbreak was declared as a pandemic by World Health Organization. Everyone I saw were wearing masks to shield themselves from the incoming invasion, a strain of viruses known as <b>SARS-CoV-2</b>.
    <p>People were dying left and right as many caught the infection, failling into terminal illness.</p>
    <p>Almost all airports were closed due to this disaster, and the hoarding of resources became increasingly more common.</p>
    <p>In some areas, hotels were converted into quarantine zones for the virus.</p>
    <p>I never recognized the magnitude of this situation, until February 2022.</p>
    <h2>Brink of Collapse</h2>
    <p>My mother was hit with the sickness, and it spread on to me, then finally my father.</p>
    <p>For a moment, everything felt normal. It felt to us like an ordinary flu, nothing seemed off.</p>
    <p>However, once my father finally caught it... something horrible happened to him.</p>
    <p>He caught pneumonia, a lung infection that causes inflammation and fluid in the alveoli (the air sacs within the lungs), making it extremely difficult to breathe.</p>
    <h3>Safe Zone</h3>
    <p>My father was taken to the hospital for 2 weeks. He had occasional video calls with us in his hospital bed, and... it was slightly worrying.</p>
    <p>What would happen? Would he make it? Would everything return to normal?</p>
    <p>Thankfully, a miracle happened. He was healing. He got less and less sick until he fully recovered.</p>
    <p>And even after all of this, the hospital payed for it. The government payed for each of the patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, making sure it was completely free for everyone.</p>
    <h3>The Grand Cure</h3>
    <p>Finally, a few months after the event, a cure was developed. We had two progressive shots, a primary and, after 6 months, a booster shot.</p>
    <p>
    When we got to the hospital, we went to get those injections, and once the needle pierced through my skin… unlike

    there were no cries for help, no painful stings—just a single weird feeling on my shoulder, and… nothing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    It felt strange. Weird. I couldn’t comprehend it.
    </p>

    <p>
    And just like that, our worries, pain, and suffering all ended. We were immune now.
